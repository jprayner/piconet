# nodejs/examples/monitor

This example shows how to implement a NodeJS-based equivalent of the Acorn NETMON utility.

## Hardware prerequisites

- Build/acquire hardware: https://github.com/jprayner/piconet/tree/main/board
- Install the latest firmware onto the board as desribed here: https://github.com/jprayner/piconet#getting-started

## Software prerequisites

- Install the latest version of NodeJS: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

## Install dependencies & run

Execute the following commands from this directory:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You should see output like the following:

```
Connecting to board...
Connected
Listening for traffic...
```

Try executing something like this from a beeb:

```
*I AM JPR93 MYPASS
```

You should see the following on your local machine:

Hit ctrl+c to exit gracefully.

If you have trouble during the board connection step, refer to the driver
